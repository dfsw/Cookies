# Just Natural Expansion 0.0.1 - A Cookie Clicker Mod

A comprehensive expansion mod for Cookie Clicker that adds new achievements, upgrades, and features while maintaining compatibility with the vanilla game.

This mod adds a total of **459 new achievements** and **252 new upgrades** to Cookie Clicker, significantly expanding the endgame content and providing new goals for long-term players.

Many achievements are tracked across multiple ascensions or involve progress that the base game does not normally record, such as popping Shiny Wrinklers. While you may have already completed some of these, there is no way to determine your progress on them unless the mod is installed. Progress on items not tracked by the vanilla game or not carried across ascensions will only start being recorded once the mod is active. You can view additional tracked stats and their current values in the Stats menu.

## Special Thanks

A very special thank you to the creator of the [Darky Cheevos Package](https://github.com/hyoretsu/DarkysCheevosPackage) Cookie Clicker mod â€” wherever you may be. I borrowed some of your custom icons, and your mod provided valuable guidance and inspiration during development.

Another big thanks to the active members of the Cookie Clicker Discord, who answered my questions about late-game strategy and helped shape the direction this mod ultimately took.

## Features

## New Achievements

### Challenge Achievements (15 achievements)
*Note: Yes, these challenges are all doable, and no, none of them are absurdly impossible (No ECM Life Here). But do not expect a free ride. These achievments won't hold your hand, and they definitely won't go easy on you. Think of them less like a grind and more like a puzzle, one that needs clever planning, careful timing, and maybe a lucky cookie or well placed upgrade. Remember this is extending the late game and adding game play time, you should not be looking to knock these all out in a week.*
